RouteTest
=========

RouteTest is a sample app that demonstrates how to get information about an AirPlay device after it's been connected to. I built this in roughly 20 minutes in response to [this StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19236962/is-there-an-api-for-retrieving-the-apple-tvs-version) asking how the Netflix app is able to prompt about an AppleTV being out of date.
